The Romi Chassis project for Team 5740 Java development learning.

## Configuring the Pi
Following these instructions here:
https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/romi-robot/imaging-romi.html

### Image Download
I downloaded the Raspberry Pi image from the WPILib Github Repo. (https://github.com/wpilibsuite/WPILibPi/releases/download/v2021.1.1/WPILibPi_image-v2021.1.1-Romi.zip)

Save this file to a place you'll remember. 

### Imaging
Following the instructions here: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vision-processing/wpilibpi/installing-the-image-to-your-microsd-card.html

Next, put the image on the Micro SD Card.

Use Etcher to copy the zip file to the SD Card. That is, do not unzip the file.

Install the microSD card, and applied power to the Pi (via the Romi 32U4 board). 

The Pi will come up as WPILibPi-[random numbers]. It might take several minutes, possibly 5 or more.

Connected the laptop wifi to the Access point. The default WiFi access password is `WPILib2021!`. 

Once connected, use your Web Browser to go to this web page: `http://wpilibpi.local/` 
Success! I can view the Pi status page.

## Update the Firmware.
